                    <p class="story-intro">From the narrow lanes of a Mumbai chawl to premieres in Hollywood, Harnish Ambaliya has redefined what it means to build a life in film. A producer and cinematographer with over a decade of experience, his journey is one of resilience transformed into craft, and adversity reshaped into art.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before Los Angeles, Harnish was already shaping India's commercial and music landscape — producing high-profile ads, PSAs, and music videos with leading agencies and artists. These early years taught him how to deliver under pressure, lead crews at scale, and hold ambitious creative visions together — skills that became invaluable when he turned toward narrative filmmaking.</p>
                    
                    <p>A graduate of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, Harnish quickly stood out. His work was featured at USC's First Look Festival and earned a nomination at the 44th College Television Awards, recognition of his rare ability to balance bold visual storytelling with production precision.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2025, he made his feature debut as both producer and cinematographer with the dark romantic comedy <em>Open House</em>, directed by Jonah Gleeman and co-produced with longtime collaborators Don John and Oliver Kiisa. The film captures Harnish's dual strengths: the lyricism of a cinematographer and the pragmatism of a producer.</p>
                    
                    <p>But behind the résumé lies a story that resonates far beyond film sets. Growing up in a one-room home in Mumbai, Harnish never saw cinema as a possibility. "Filmmaking wasn't the dream," he says, "it was the bridge." Today, he stands among a new wave of South Asian voices shaping Hollywood — Indian-born, U.S.-trained, and internationally active.</p>
