                    <p class="story-intro">My journey didn't start with a dream of filmmaking; it started with a dream of survival. Growing up in a one-room home in the narrow lanes of a Mumbai chawl, cinema wasn't a possibility—it was a distant hope. Filmmaking found me, and it became the bridge that transformed my resilience into a craft, and my adversity into art.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before I arrived in Los Angeles, I spent over a decade shaping India’s commercial and music landscape, producing high-profile ads and music videos for leading artists and agencies. Those years taught me invaluable skills: how to lead a crew, work under pressure, and bring ambitious creative visions to life.</p>

                    <p>A graduate of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, I quickly realized that my path had prepared me for this next chapter. My work, which balances bold visual storytelling with precise production, began to stand out. I was nominated for a student Emmy for my work as cinematographer and producer on the multi-cam sitcom thesis, "Failure to Launch," and was awarded a Panavision New Filmmaker grant to shoot the short film "Dead Pet Shark" on 35mm film.</p>

                    <p>In 2025, I made my feature debut as both producer and cinematographer on the dark romantic comedy <em>Open House</em>. This film, for me, captures my dual strengths: the pragmatism of a producer and the lyricism of a cinematographer.</p>

                    <p>Today, I am proud to be an Indian-born, U.S.-trained, and internationally active voice among a new wave of South Asian filmmakers shaping Hollywood. My story is one of breaking frames and borders, and I believe that behind every compelling image is a life lived, a story told.</p>
